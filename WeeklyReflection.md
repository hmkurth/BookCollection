# Weekly Reflection

##Week 1
Time Spent On Project: 30 minutes<br/>
This week I solidified my project idea with Paula and posted in Slack what my 
project will include, and why I chose to pursue this idea!

##Week 2
Time Spent On Project: 1 hour <br/>
During activity 3 we set up this repository in GitHub and learned about the
general set up we will be using. This is my first semester with IntelliJ, so 
some of these tasks take longer than I anticipate. That will, hopefully, 
improve as time goes on, and I have more practice with the program!
