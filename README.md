# LeeAnn Jakel Individual Project

## Problem Statement
Across the globe book lovers are struggling to remember what books they have
in their book collections when not at home to investigate. This Book Collection
application will allow users to catalog their book collection and view it from
anywhere: a bookstore, a friend's house, or even the comfort of their own couch.
The application will store book title, author, genre, a brief description, and 
allows the user to upload a photo of the cover, a location in their 
home where the book is stored, as well as the option of adding a note of any 
kind. I personally would add who I lent the book to in the notes section, but it
could be used for a short personal review if preferred!
